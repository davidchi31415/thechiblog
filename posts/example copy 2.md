# The Curious Case of Disordered Proteins

Intrinsically disordered proteins â€” a paradigm-shattering phenomenon, a "*dark matter*" of biology, and a key to modern medicine? 

Outline:

* Intro 
    * Review of folded proteins
    * What IDPs are and why they are so different
    * When / how they were first discovered
* Importance
    * Abundance in nature
    * Examples of cellular roles
    * How they function despite (or rather, how they benefit from) disorder
    * Examples of disease roles
        * Target for medicines?
* Drug Discovery
    * Traditional approaches for folded proteins
        * Structure necessary
        * Normally, just small molecule inhibitors for protein-ligand
    * Disorder-based approaches
        * Allows a brand new approach to be enabled (protein-protein interface inhibtion)
        * Mechanism of inhibition of protein-protein inhibition
        * Examples of current works / areas of research using disorder focus
* Roadblocks and Solutions
    * Difficulties in experimental characterization
        * Examples
    * Computational approaches more viable but still not smooth-sailing
        * Machine learning models
            * Classifiers and inference models
        * Lack of data
    * Solutions
        * Other current approaches
        * Generative model for sequence design
* Conclusion
